Given a temporally growing tensor, how can we analyze it efficiently? Multi-dimensional arrays or tensors have been widely used to model real world data. Tensor decomposition plays a significant role in latent feature discovery and estimation of unobservable entries. Each tensor can be classified as static or dynamic. A tensor whose size and values are temporally changing is dynamic (e.g. sensor data on every point of the room), and the other is static. Most of existing tensor analysis methods such as \cpals and \hosvd decompose static tensors with high fitness.

Data stream produces numerous amounts of data every second and it became more important to maintain tensor factorization result. Every dynamic tensor can have an extra temporal mode and previous state of the tensor can be stored along the mode. Growing in the temporal mode, however, applying static tensor factorization methods to dynamic is an inappropriate way in time and space efficiency. It invokes lots of computations to update all the entries of time factor matrix. The contributions of this project are the following:
\bit
\item \method performs online tensor decomposition preserving accuracy without time dilation due to short data income intervals.
\item \method is time scalable, being linear on the length of temporal mode. 
\item \method automatically detects drastic data changes and creates new starting point of decomposition.
