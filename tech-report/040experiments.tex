We implemented our method
and compared it with the older ones.
The results are very promising.

Figure \ref{fig:results} shows our results:
Figure \ref{fig:results}(a) gives a scatter-plot
of the $N$ sound-clips, where the axis are the two main
features we propose to use $\ldots$
Figure \ref{fig:results}(b) shows the wall-clock time
of our method, versus the size of the database $N$.
